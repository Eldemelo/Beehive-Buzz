## Observation 1: News Branch
* Observation Statement: The News Branch should be the lowest priority when creating the features for the app
* Supporting Data: It was the the only feature that recieved a 1 on the user research survey and got more votes in the 1-3 range than in the 3-5 range. 
* Team Action (if any): Worry about this feature last if we have time, not a necessity

## Observation 2

* Observation Statement: Many users either already attend local events, or wish to attend more
* Supporting Data: 33% of the users surveyed state they'd love an events tab, with 39% stating they would probably use it and the remaining 28% stating they might use it but might not.
* Team Action: Create a dedicated events section in the app for easy viewing of upcoming events

- The survey results imply private messaging is an okay feature, but users aren't certain they will use it. The group thinks people are more likely to share the content to other messaging platforms.

## Observation 3
* Observation Statement: 0 votes for 'why would you add this'
* Supporting Data: Majority voted 'might use' feature
* Team Action: DMs are second to last, in front of local news.
