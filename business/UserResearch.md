##Observation 1: News Branch
*Observation Statement: The News Branch should be the lowest priority when creating the features for the app
*Supporting Data: It was the the only feature that recieved a 1 on the user research survey and got more votes in the 1-3 range than in the 3-5 range. 
*Team Action (if any): Worry about this feature last if we have time, not a necessity
