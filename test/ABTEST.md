## AB Test

Include Events in Main Feed

### User Story Number

US5: Signing Up for an Event

### Metrics

Number of Event Sign-Ups (main focus), also observe effect on time spent in app and number of likes on posts to determine how much this change intrudes on other uses for the main feed

### Hypothesis

Users may find it awkward to have to go to a specific Events tab to sign up for events, so including events on the main feed may make them more accessible.

### Experiment

30% of the user base will be given the new version of the main feed with events, while the remaining 70% will keep the old version of the main feed. If event sign-ups are significantly higher for the testing group, that will be evidence of the change having the intended effect. If users in the testing group have significantly lower likes on posts, that could be a sign that this change has adverse effects on other uses of the app.

### Variations

The testing group (30% of the user base) will be given a new version of the main feed which includes both general posts and events. The control group (70% of the user base) will continue using the original version of the app where events only appear in a separate tab.

## A/B Test

User Profile Layout have username in main textfield or edit button

### User Story Number

US6 - Updating User Profile Info

### Metrics

The HEART metric this would test for is user engagement. It would see whether they preferred the layout of one over the other

### Hypothesis
Having the username edit changed from a field in the user profile page, to a button will help with clarity on the difference between the display name and the username

### Experiment

In firebase, we will split 50/50 userbase both layouts of the profile page. We will test how often the users attempt to edit their username vs their display name and track how often they cancel a username change

### Variations

We would test 2 variations of the profile page one which has a username change button, and one which has the username in a normal text field

# Brandon Ezovski

## A/B Test 

User Profile Button Location

### User Story Number

US6 - Updating User Profile Info

### Metrics

This change will focus on the Engagement section of the HEART framework. It will test whether users engage with changing their profile more frequently.

### Hypothesis
Changing the location of the user profile button will make it easier for users to find and access. 

### Expiriment

We'll split the users 50/50 using firebase's capabilities, and test how frequently they access their profile page to see which button placement gets higher engagement. 



### Variations

The two possible variations for the location of the user profile button will be A: in the hotbar at the bottom of the screen with a generic user icon, or B: at the top left of the screen with the user's profile picture as the icon.

## A/B Test
Change Login screen spacing & padding 

### User Story Number
US2: Account Login

### Metrics
Engagement. Measure How often users login.


### Hypothesis
We want to see if the layout of the login screen has an affect on how often users use the app.

## Experiment
50% of users will be able to see the test version. The text fields will have more spacing  and the app logo will be centered. The users' frewuency of logins will be tracked between the two versions to evaluate if one version leads to more logins/ use of the app. We will use Firebase Analytics to make a variable that counts how many times a user logs in and how long they spend on the app.

## Variations
There will be the original variation and the test variation, with added spacing and a centered logo.
