## A/B Test 

User Profile Button Location

### User Story Number

US6 - Updating User Profile Info

### Metrics

This change will focus on the Engagement section of the HEART framework. It will test whether users engage with changing their profile more frequently.

### Hypothesis
Changing the location of the user profile button will make it easier for users to find and access. 

### Expiriment

We'll split the users 50/50 using firebase's capabilities, and test how frequently they access their profile page to see which button placement gets higher engagement. 

### Variations

The two possible variations for the location of the user profile button will be A: in the hotbar at the bottom of the screen with a generic user icon, or B: at the top left of the screen with the user's profile picture as the icon.
