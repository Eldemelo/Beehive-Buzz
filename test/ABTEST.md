## A/B Test

User Profile Layout have username in main textfield or edit button

### User Story Number

US6 - Updating User Profile Info

### Metrics

The HEART metric this would test for is user engagement. It would see whether they preferred the layout of one over the other

### Hypothesis

Having the username edit changed from a field in the user profile page, to a button will help with clarity on the difference between the display name and the username

### Experiment

In firebase, we will split 50/50 userbase both layouts of the profile page. We will test how often the users attempt to edit their username vs their display name and track how often they cancel a username change

### Variations

We would test 2 variations of the profile page one which has a username change button, and one which has the username in a normal text field
