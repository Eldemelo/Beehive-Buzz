## AB Test: Include Events in Main Feed

### User Story Number: 5

### Metrics: Number of Event Sign-Ups (main focus), also observe effect on time spent in app and number of likes on posts to determine how much this change intrudes on other uses for the main feed

### Hypothesis: Users may find it awkward to have to go to a specific Events tab to sign up for events, so including events on the main feed may make them more accessible.

### Experiment: 30% of the user base will be given the new version of the main feed with events, while the remaining 70% will keep the old version of the main feed. If event sign-ups are significantly higher for the testing group, that will be evidence of the change having the intended effect. If users in the testing group have significantly lower likes on posts, that could be a sign that this change has adverse effects on other uses of the app.

### Variations: The testing group (30% of the user base) will be given a new version of the main feed which includes both general posts and events. The control group (70% of the user base) will continue using the original version of the app where events only appear in a separate tab.
